# Fast-automated-drift-correction

This is the notebook I used for the experimental workflow and data analysis of the Article: M.Checa et. al "Fast automated drift correction for functional SPM imaging "(2023).

There are 2 codes one used for the experimental automatization of the experiment and one for the data analysis and visualization used in the paper.
